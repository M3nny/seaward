### Installation
``` console
cargo install seaward
```

## NetBSD
On NetBSD a pre-compiled binary is available from the official repositories. To install it, simply run:
``` console
pkgin install seaward
```

## Overview
Seaward is used to discover every link on a web page (and its linked pages) without duplicates or to search for a word starting from the given URL.

If you want to save the links inside a file, you can run `seaward <URL> --silent > file.txt`, and if you experience many timeout errors try using a higher timeout with `-t`.
With the `-d 0` option you crawl only the web page passed in the `<URL>` parameter, with `-d 1` also the pages linked to it (always within the same web site) and so on.

## Usage

``` console
seaward -h
```
This will display every option.

``` console
seaward: 1.0.0

seaward is a crawler which searches for links or a specified word in a website.
Use -h for short descriptions and --help for more details.
